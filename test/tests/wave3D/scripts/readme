1. Make the mesh coarse, but not single element in inputs/globals.i
   If you do this, you may comment out hpc command and include
   "-np **" in the following scripts. It is also fine to limit
   the number of runs by deleting rows in synthetic/acquisitions.csv

2. After getting acquisition info into synthetic/, run sampler.hpc
   two times to make sure that synthetic data is populated well,
   and misfit is zero

3. Run test_invert.hpc to make sure that misfit and gradient are zero

4. Run check_grad.hpc to check gradients



IF NO CODE CHANGES JUST DO THE FOLLOWING
----------------------------------------

5. After the above steps, if did coarsening in step 1, you need to 
   refine the mesh back in inputs/globals.i. You need to rerun 
   step 2 with fine mesh or checkout files from repo.

6. Run test_invert.hpc to make sure that the objective is indeed zero

7. Run multires.sh after checking res1,2,3.hpc make sense
